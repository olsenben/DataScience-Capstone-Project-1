# Capstone Project 1 - Milestone Report
### Prepared by Ben Olsen
## What Is The Problem You Want To Solve?
In short, this project was an effort to determine the usefulness of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, which in short is 
an "introspective self-report questionnaire with the purpose of indicating differing psychological preferences in how people 
perceive the world around them and make decisions" according to Wikipedia. While generally accepted by various internet
communities as a valid assement of personality type, the professional field of psychology and other technical researchers have
more or less discarded to test due to its poor retestibility results, mostly due to the fact that is relys on categorical 
classification based on a continuous scale (a difference of one point could result in a misclassication, a margin of error that
professionals find too minimal to be useful). While the clinical application of the test has been discredietd as unreliable and 
ultimately left to the wayside by clinicians, the test's usefulness has yet to be evaluated in the context of online behavior.
This project will attempt to validate the relevance of the MBTI in an online social context based on an analysis of a person's 
online posting characteristics, specifically by examining the features of text that he or she post online. While MBTI is no 
longer considered to be theoretically validated construction of personality, a distiguishable difference in features of text per
reported personality that of other personalities could potentially point a manifestation of personality in posting style, as well
as a relevance in testing other, more clinically sound personality tests (such as the Big 5) as the information becomes more 
readily accessible.
