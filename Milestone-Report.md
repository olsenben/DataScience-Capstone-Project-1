# Capstone Project 1 - Milestone Report
### Prepared by Ben Olsen
## What Is The Problem You Want To Solve?
This project is an effort to determine the usefulness of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, which in short is 
an "introspective self-report questionnaire with the purpose of indicating differing psychological preferences in how people 
perceive the world around them and make decisions" according to Wikipedia. While generally accepted by various internet
communities as a valid assement of personality type, the professional field of psychology and other technical researchers have
more or less discarded this test due to its poor retestibility results, mostly due to the fact that it relies on categorical 
classification based on a continuous scale (a difference of one point could result in a misclassication, a margin of error that professionals find too unforgiving to be useful). While the clinical application of the test has been discredietd as unreliable and ultimately left to the wayside by clinicians, the test's usefulness has yet to be evaluated in the context of online behavior. This project will attempt to validate the relevance of the MBTI in an online social context based on an analysis of a person's online posting characteristics, specifically by examining the features of text that he or she post online. While MBTI is no longer considered to be theoretically validated construction of personality, a distiguishable difference in features of text per reported personality that of other personalities could potentially point a manifestation of personality in posting style, as well as a relevance in testing other, more clinically sound personality tests (such as the Big 5) as the data becomes more readily accessible.
## Who Is Your Client And Why Do They Care About This Problem?
Natural language processing and classification has a variety of applications varying in usefulness, but the ability to analyze text and classify people into personality types based on their choice of language has few specific uses that stand out as particularly valuable accomplish the goals of various kinds of clients.
#### 1. Media and Content Delivery

   Media companies have build long and illustrious histories of reporting valuable news and delivering useful content in the past, but in the 21st century the move to digital media began to wreck havoc on many last century media giants. The shift in media consumption habits created a valuable marketplace online for digital media gurus to new ways to deliever content, and one of the more modern inventions of content delivery of this century is curate content, which is content delivery tailored to specific audiences based on their media consumption habits. The ability to classify content based on the word usage of the writer to know that writers personality style will also reveal what kind of readers the content will resonate with. Additionally, being able to classify users based on their language usage can reveal valuable details about them that can help tailor specific content for their  consumption.

#### 2. Targeted Advertising

   Many modern companies are very image-centric, meaning that they monitor their public image and the ethos that they exude quite religiously. Knowing what subset of personality types that their advertising campaigns are resonating with provides another layer of understanding beyond simple sentiment analysis. Additionally, a marketing company could more easily target user subsets by identifying their personality types based on their language choice in their posting style and tailor ad content to that particular personality type.
   
#### 3. Hiring

   Hiring agencies understand how important it is for a person's personality to match the workplace where they are being placed. Hoever, much foreward-facing content that individuals contribute to professional sites where networking and professionalism are the aim is carefully curated and oriented to be apear professional and appealing. Beyond this curated offering, there is really no way to get a glimpse of what a person is like without a third-party reference to their strengths, weaknesses, and personality attributes. Being able ascertain personality traits from a person's writing style would provide an unbiased measure of where their strengths might lie and what placement would suit them best.
